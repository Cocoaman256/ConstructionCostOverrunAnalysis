# CONSTRUCTONCOSTOVERRUNANALYSIS
I carried out a cost analysis on various construction projects across the United State to establish some root causes of their high cost overruns and project delays

# Dataset: BIM AI Engineering Integrated Dataset (Kaggle)
# BRIEF
For this project, I decided to use data that included factors across thw while life cycle management of civil engineering projects such as covering cost, schedule, structural health, environmental conditions, resource allocation, labour hours, safety risks etc.

# OBJECTIVE
To identify various causes or factors that influence construction projects and might lead to delayed times and cost overruns

# FINDINGS
Through careful analysis, I recognized that the average project delayed by over an average of 100 days and had a cost over run of over $5million with building projects in Los Angeles experiencing the largest of over $6m. While these delays caused an increase in risk as the projects approached completion, less than half the projects managed to attain a 50% completion rate.
Various conditions did lead to these schedule and cost over runs such as weather conditions as areas with less predictable weather conditions such as rain and cold faced larger cost over runs than areas that experienced predictable weather conditions such as sun and snow.
To mitigate this, these areas imposed longer work hours of over 6000 labour hours, a strategy still being implemented today.
